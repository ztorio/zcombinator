# Work Request

Discord username: @Sadghost

**Note**: Use this for work requiring team access (permissioned protocol access, migrations, fee changes, etc.). If you're submitting code yourself, use "Code Contribution" instead.

## What Should Be Built?

I am seeking to adjust the inflation of the daily emitted tokens based off PR #48 from ≈960k to ≈935k.. The extra 25k tokens daily should be given to Sadghost as renumeration for been the Discord and X community Moderator of the ZCombinator launchpad.



## Why Does This Matter?

The ZCombinator ecosystem/community benefit off the payment plan because;
-A paid Moderator is motivated to be consistent.
- Moderator is an actual Job role in Web3 and paying a Mod shows the professionalism and seriousness of both the core team and the community.
-Encourages Fairness.

The ZCombinator community will benefit from this Decision if it passes because the Moderator/Zod assists with;
-Strong Community Management

-Protects the Project’s Reputation
Zods quickly handle FUD, spam, scams, and misinformation before they spread on both the Discord and X community page. This keeps the project’s public image clean.

-Faster Support for Users
Zods answer questions, guide newcomers, reducing pressure on the core team.

-Creates a Safe Environment
Zods enforce rules, remove harmful messages, and make sure everyone feels respected and secure.

-Acts as a Bridge Between Team & Community

-Improves User Retention & Growth
A well-managed community is more attractive to new users and keeps existing members loyal.

-Enables the Team to Focus on Building
With the Moderator/Zod handling the front line, the core team can focus on product, partnerships, and strategy.


**Who benefits:**

Zcombinator Moderator

**Expected outcome:**

Adjust the inflation of the daily emitted tokens based off PR #48 from ≈960k to ≈935k.. The extra 25k tokens daily should be given to Sadghost

## Supporting Evidence

-Most successful Web3 projects (e.g., Layer 2s, launchpads, and major protocols) compensate moderators because community management directly affects user trust and platform adoption.

-Active moderation has been shown to increase user retention and reduce churn, especially for new users joining during key announcements or market activity.

-Unmoderated or under-moderated communities often experience higher rates of scams, FUD, and confusion, which harms credibility and slows growth.

-My daily presence and response rate have already helped reduce spam, resolve user issues faster, and maintain consistent activity, demonstrating clear value to the ecosystem.
